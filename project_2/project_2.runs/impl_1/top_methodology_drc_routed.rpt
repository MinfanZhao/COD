2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -26.942 ns between SW[9] (clocked by clk_virt) and LED[9] (clocked by clk_virt). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -26.975 ns between SW[2] (clocked by clk_virt) and LED[2] (clocked by clk_virt). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -26.977 ns between SW[4] (clocked by clk_virt) and LED[4] (clocked by clk_virt).
